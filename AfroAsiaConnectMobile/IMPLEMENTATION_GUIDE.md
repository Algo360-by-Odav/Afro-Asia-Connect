## 🚨 Known Issues and Solutions

### React Native CLI Missing
**Issue**: `react-native depends on @react-native-community/cli for cli commands`

**Solution**: Install the CLI dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @react-native-community/cli@latest
```

### Java Development Kit (JDK) Missing
**Issue**: `No Java compiler found, please ensure you are running Gradle with a JDK`

**Problem**: You have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) but need Java Development Kit (JDK)

**Solution**: Install JDK 11 or higher:
1. **Download JDK**: Go to https://adoptium.net/ or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
2. **Install JDK 11 or 17** (recommended for React Native)
3. **Set JAVA_HOME environment variable**:
   - Windows: `JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-11.0.x.x-hotspot`
   - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to your PATH
4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```
   Both should show JDK version, not just JRE

**Alternative**: Use Android Studio's bundled JDK:
- Install Android Studio
- Set `JAVA_HOME` to Android Studio's JDK path
- Usually: `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jre`

### TypeScript Issues
- Some Redux Persist type conflicts may occur
- Solution: Use explicit type casting where needed
- Fixed selector usage in ProfileScreen and DashboardScreen

### Metro Bundler Issues
- Clear cache if experiencing build issues:
  ```bash
  npx react-native start --reset-cache
  ```
- If Metro fails to start, try:
  ```bash
  npx react-native start --port=8082
  ```

### Android Build Issues
- Clean and rebuild if needed:
  ```bash
  cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && npx react-native run-android
  ```
- If Gradle sync fails:
  ```bash
  cd android && ./gradlew clean && ./gradlew build
  ```

### iOS Build Issues (macOS only)
- Clean build folder:
  ```bash
  cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd ..
  ```
- Reset CocoaPods:
  ```bash
  cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install && cd ..
  ```

### Common Development Issues

**Port Already in Use**:
```bash
# Kill process on port 8081
npx react-native start --port=8082
```

**Module Resolution Issues**:
```bash
# Clear all caches
npm start -- --reset-cache
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

**Android Emulator Not Detected**:
- Ensure Android Studio is installed
- Start emulator before running `npx react-native run-android`
- Check `adb devices` to see connected devices
